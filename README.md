# custom-customizer-postmeta

This is an experimental plugin to add custom post meta fields to the customizer. It requires the Customize Posts plugin. Custom Post Meta info is pulled as JSON from the /meta-info/meta-info.json file, and added to the appropriate post type editor sections within the WordPress customizer.
