# Add Custom Customizer Postmeta

[https://github.com/Invulu/custom-customizer-postmeta](https://github.com/Invulu/custom-customizer-postmeta)

##Description

This is an experimental plugin to add custom post meta fields to the customizer. It requires the [Customize Posts plugin](https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts) by Weston Ruter.

Custom Post Meta info is pulled from the /meta-info/meta-info.json file, and added to the appropriate post type editor sections within the WordPress customizer.

It's only been tested with 'text', 'checkbox', 'select' and 'post_editor' inputs so far.

See the meta-info.json file for examples of how to add postmeta controls, and edit it to add the controls to your site.
